Tutor: Great job! Your implementation of the bubble sort algorithm looks correct. It should sort the list in ascending 
order. Do you have any questions about the code or the algorithm?

Student: No, I think I understand it. Thank you for your help!

Tutor: You're welcome! Don't hesitate to ask if you have any other questions. Good luck with your coding!
